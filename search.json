    "text": "Summary\nOur analysis reveals concerning patterns in the security situation faced by aid workers all over the world, with a particularly sharp situation in the Palestinian territories in 2024. While the data shows an overall increasing trend in incidents globally over the years, the concentration of fatal incidents in the Palestinian territories in 2024 stands out as an unprecedented humanitarian emergency. Besides, the distinct pattern of high fatalities with almost no kidnappings in the Palestinian territories reflects the intense nature of the conflict there.These findings highlight the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Palestinian territories.\nAfghanistan remains a chronic high-risk environment for aid workers. This problem may be due to the large number of humanitarian workers caught up in the war in Afghanistan.\nThe international community must prioritize the protection of humanitarian workers who risk their lives to provide essential services to vulnerable populations in conflict areas. Without such protection and a path to peace, the ability of aid organizations to operate effectively in those areas is severely compromised, further exacerbating the suffering of civilians. In addition, the risks to the work of these workers can be fundamentally eliminated if the various countries of interest can peacefully reach an agreement."

    "text": "Summary of High-Risk Country Analysis\nOur detailed examination of high-risk countries has revealed crucial patterns and insights that can inform targeted security strategies for humanitarian operations:\n\nDistinct Risk Profiles:\n\nAfghanistan emerges as the highest-risk environment overall, with the most incidents and a balanced distribution of deaths, injuries, and kidnappings\nSouth Sudan shows a distinctive pattern with injuries significantly outnumbering deaths and kidnappings, reflecting its particular conflict dynamics\nSyria stands out for its high proportion of aerial bombardment incidents, a unique characteristic among the examined countries\nEach country presents a different risk signature requiring tailored security approaches\n\nTemporal and Seasonal Variations:\n\nSignificant year-to-year fluctuations exist, with Afghanistan experiencing a major peak in 2013 and Sudan showing a concerning surge in 2024\nMonthly patterns vary dramatically by country: Afghanistan incidents concentrate in summer months, while Syria shows a bimodal distribution with peaks in winter and summer\nThese temporal patterns have critical implications for the timing of humanitarian operations and security planning\n\nAttack Method Variations:\n\nAttack methods show strong country-specific patterns: Afghanistan sees predominantly shootings and kidnappings, South Sudan features shootings and bodily assault, and Syria experiences unique aerial bombardment threats\nThese differences explain the varying casualty profiles, with bodily assault in South Sudan leading to more injuries than deaths, while aerial bombardments in Syria result in different casualty patterns\n\nCasualty Relationships:\n\nThe bubble chart reveals how deaths, injuries, and kidnappings relate differently across countries\nAfghanistan occupies an extreme position across all dimensions, while Sudan shows a disproportionately high injury count\nThese patterns reflect not only differences in attack types but potentially also variations in medical response capabilities and reporting practices\n\n\nThese findings underscore the critical importance of context-specific security strategies. A one-size-fits-all approach to humanitarian security is clearly inadequate given the distinctive risk profiles, seasonal patterns, and attack characteristics in each country. Organizations must develop tailored security protocols that account for these specific risk factors, including seasonal planning, transport security measures that reflect local attack patterns, and medical preparedness aligned with the most likely casualty types in each context.\nThe surge in incidents in Sudan during 2024 merits particular attention and may require immediate security reassessment for operations in that region. Similarly, the consistent high-risk profile of Afghanistan calls for sustained and comprehensive security measures across all operational dimensions."

For example, in Syria, planning must include protection from airstrikes. In Afghanistan, summer months bring more attacks.\nImprove Transport Safety: Roads are the most dangerous locations. Use safer travel routes, movement tracking, and convoy systems.\nSupport Local Staff Equally: Local teams need the same level of training, security gear, and evacuation options as international staff.\nAdjust for Seasonality: Some regions have seasonal spikes in violence. Planning should change with the calendar—for example, Afghanistan sees more incidents in summer.\n\n\n\nFor Field Security Staff\n\nLook Beyond Incident Counts: Include method of attack, type of attacker, and location when assessing risk.\nWatch for Local Warning Signs: For example, ambushes are common in Afghanistan. Security staff should build early-warning systems based on local patterns."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis report shows that humanitarian work is becoming more dangerous, especially in places like the Palestinian territories in 2024. Local staff face the greatest risks. Each country presents different threats. Routes, seasons, and attacker types all affect how danger unfolds.\nTo keep aid workers safe, organizations must use local data, plan for specific risks, and close the gap between local and international staff support. This is not just about better planning—it’s about protecting the people who risk their lives to help others.\nTheir safety must be a shared responsibility."

    "text": "Humanitarian aid workers face growing danger as they deliver life-saving help in conflict zones, disaster areas, and unstable regions. Using data from the Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD), this report explores the patterns behind attacks on aid workers around the world. The goal is to understand where and how these threats occur and to offer specific insights that can support safer operations.\nThis analysis moves from a broad view to detailed country-specific risks.\n\n\nWe begin with a global overview of incidents over time and by region. The data shows that attacks on aid workers are becoming more frequent and more deadly. In 2024, the Palestinian territories saw a sharp rise in fatal attacks, the highest ever recorded. This increase shows that even in places where humanitarian work should be protected, violence continues to grow.\nThe most dangerous areas include parts of the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Afghanistan has long been the most deadly country for aid workers. This section sets the stage by showing how widespread and serious the risk has become.\n\n\n\nNext, we look at how aid workers are being attacked and who is behind these attacks. Shootings are the most common type, while kidnapping-killings, shootings, and bombings are the most deadly. Different groups use different methods. For example, non-state armed groups often carry out shootings and kidnappings, while coalition forces use airstrikes.\nThese patterns help explain the different types of danger that aid workers face, and they provide important details for planning security measures.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we explore the deeper reasons behind the violence. We look at what motivates attackers, what kinds of groups are responsible, and what role local context plays. For example, ambushes on roads are especially dangerous, and many of the 2024 incidents in the Palestinian territories happened during combat or crossfire.\nA key concern is the growing gap between the risks faced by local aid workers and their international colleagues. Local staff are more likely to be killed or injured, often because they have less access to protection or evacuation.\n\n\n\nFinally, we zoom in on some of the highest-risk countries. Each place has its own pattern of attacks. In Afghanistan, risks are spread across killings, injuries, and kidnappings. In South Sudan, most incidents cause injuries. In Syria, many attacks come from the air.\nThese examples show that security risks vary by country and need local solutions. What works in one place might not work in another. Planning must be based on local data and real conditions."

    "section": "Summary of Risk Characteristics",
    "text": "Summary of Risk Characteristics\nThrough our analysis of security incidents affecting aid workers, several critical patterns have emerged:\n\nAttack Methods:\n\nShooting incidents represent the most common form of attack against aid workers, despite firearms typically being more regulated than other weapons\nThe most lethal attack methods are kidnapping-killings, shootings, and aerial bombardments, which show the highest fatality rates\nKidnapping incidents, while traumatic, tend to result in fewer immediate casualties as the primary goal is abduction rather than causing harm\n\nTarget Organizations:\n\nInternational NGOs (INGOs), National NGOs (NNGOs), and UN agencies are the most frequently targeted organizations\nDifferent organizations face varying risk profiles, with peaks in attacks occurring at different times\nINGOs experienced their highest casualty rates in 2019, while UN agencies saw a dramatic increase in 2023\nNNGOs are currently facing their highest recorded level of attacks in 2024, suggesting a troubling shift toward targeting local humanitarian organizations\n\nLocal vs International Aid Workers:\n\nLocal aid workers face disproportionately higher risks compared to their international counterparts\nThe percentage of casualties affecting local staff has been steadily increasing over time\nThis growing disparity reflects the increasing “localization” of humanitarian response, differential evacuation protocols, and unequal access to security resources\nLocal workers often maintain operations in high-risk areas after international staff have been evacuated\n\n\nThese findings highlight the complex and evolving nature of security risks in humanitarian settings. The increasing targeting of local aid workers and national organizations is particularly concerning and demands urgent attention. As the humanitarian sector continues to emphasize localization, equal investment must be made in security training, resources, and protocols for local staff and organizations.\nThe data suggests a need for tailored security approaches that consider the specific risks associated with different attack methods, organizational profiles, and staff nationalities. Additionally, the international humanitarian community should address the growing security disparity between local and international aid workers by ensuring that the localization of aid is accompanied by appropriate security measures and support."

    "section": "Summary of Risk Factors and Correlations",
    "text": "Summary of Risk Factors and Correlations\nOur comprehensive analysis of attack patterns and risk factors has uncovered several critical insights that help paint a nuanced picture of the security landscape for humanitarian workers:\n\nAttack Motives and Impact:\n\nPolitical, incidental, and economic motives dominate the landscape of attacks on aid workers, with political motives being most common\n“Contested” incidents (those with disputed motives) yield the highest average casualties per incident, nearly double that of politically motivated attacks\nDifferent motives show distinct casualty patterns: incidental attacks rarely involve kidnappings, political attacks show balanced casualty types, and economic attacks predominantly result in injuries rather than deaths\n\nPerpetrator Profiles and Tactics:\n\nNational and unknown non-state armed groups are the primary perpetrators of attacks, followed by unaffiliated actors, with global non-state armed groups committing the fewest attacks\nEach region has a distinct perpetrator profile: Afghanistan sees predominantly national and unknown non-state armed group activity, while Syria experiences more attacks from foreign or coalition forces\nDifferent actor types employ distinctive attack methods: non-state armed groups favor kidnappings and shootings, while foreign/coalition forces primarily use aerial bombardment\n\nContext and Location Vulnerabilities:\n\nAmbushes represent the most common attack context, followed by individual attacks, combat/crossfire situations, and raids\nRoads are overwhelmingly the most dangerous locations for aid workers, explaining the prevalence of ambush-style attacks\nCombat/crossfire incidents saw a dramatic spike in 2024, correlating with the conflict in Palestinian territories, and these incidents almost exclusively result in deaths and injuries rather than kidnappings\n\nGender Dimensions:\n\nWhere gender is recorded, males constitute a significantly larger proportion of casualties (47 percent) and female is about 7 percent of the total. Most of the rest are of unknown sex, which may have been left unrecorded.\nThe low percentage of females may be due to the fact that the organization prefers to send male workers into hazardous areas to provide humanitarian assistance in view of physiological differences, but it may also be due to a lack of records.\nMost of the attackers did not carry out gender-specific attacks, which shows that they did not care about the gender of their victims."
